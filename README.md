This repository contains a simple Tcl procedure that demonstrates a common, yet often overlooked, error: case-sensitive string comparison.  The `badproc` procedure incorrectly uses `==` for comparing strings instead of `eq`.  This leads to unexpected behavior when comparing strings that are identical except for case. The `bugSolution.tcl` file provides a corrected version using the `eq` operator.
